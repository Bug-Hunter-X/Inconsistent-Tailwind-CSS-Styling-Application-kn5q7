# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Styling Application

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles are not applied consistently across different components of an application, despite seemingly correct configuration and usage.  The issue is particularly challenging because it's not global; it affects only certain components.

## Problem Description

Even with careful attention to class names and Tailwind configuration, some styles are simply ignored in specific components.  Standard debugging techniques (restarting the server, purging CSS, reinstalling packages) have proven ineffective.

## Setup and Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the inconsistent application of Tailwind CSS classes in the affected components (check `bug.js` for details).

## Solution

The solution, as detailed in `bugSolution.js`, involved [insert concise description of solution, e.g., identifying a conflicting style rule, ensuring correct order of classes, or resolving a parent-child selector conflict]. This highlights the importance of carefully examining the CSS hierarchy and potential style conflicts when encountering inconsistent styling issues in Tailwind CSS.
