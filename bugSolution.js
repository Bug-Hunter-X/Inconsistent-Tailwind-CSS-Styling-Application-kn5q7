The issue was resolved by correctly ordering the Tailwind classes in the affected components. The specificity of certain classes was overriding others. By rearranging the order of the classes based on specificity, the styles applied correctly. For example, changing `bg-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-400 text-blue-500` to `text-blue-500 bg-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-400` resolved the styling conflict for one element.
