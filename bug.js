I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS wasn't applying styles as expected, even after ensuring proper configuration and class usage.  The HTML structure was straightforward, but some classes seemed to be completely ignored.  This only occurred in specific components, not globally. I've checked and double-checked for typos in class names, and I've also ensured that my `tailwind.config.js` was correctly configured to include the necessary content and paths.  I've tried purging unused styles, restarting the development server, and even reinstalling the npm package, but the problem persists.
